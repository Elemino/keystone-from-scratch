# Keystone.js online-exchange ðŸ”¥

This project started as an attempt to build an online shop but I wanted to make use of the admin capabilites of keystone and build something more useful such an exchange or a funding portal, where there's an entity that administers the exchange and users can subscribe to events and share listings id's etc. Each model has an 'add' method with different object attributes to utilize the Keystone API. This project is an example with no further ambitions.
